This is a WIP prototype of libuhwi - a C99 library for detecting PCI, USB
devices as well as other hardware components.

It supports the following OSes (at least this was the case at the time of
writing):
- FreeBSD (PCI via <sys/pciio.h>, USB via built-in libusb 1.0)
- macOS (PCI WIP, USB via IOKit)

Use the ancient version of GNU make to build on macOS, use the provided
shell script to build on FreeBSD:

   $ sh build_freebsd.sh clean
   $ sh build_freebsd.sh

Linking with the library requires you to link with the appropriate depen-
dencies as well since libuhwi is built as a static library:

   # On FreeBSD
   $ clang ... -L. -luhwi -lusb

   # on macOS
   $ clang ... -L. -luhwi -framework CoreFoundation -framework IOKit

UniHWI comes with lsuhwi - a command-line tool akin to lspci/usbconfig, but
using libuhwi instead:

   # dumps PCI and USB devices available on the system
   $ ./lsuhwi

   # dumps just the PCI devices
   $ ./lsuhwi -l
   # dumps just the USB devices
   $ ./lsuhwi -u

   # mediocre built-in usage documentation
   $ ./lsuhwi -h
