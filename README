This is a WIP prototype of libuhwi - a C99 library for detecting PCI, USB
devices as well as other hardware components.

It supports the following OSes (at least this was the case at the time of
writing):
- FreeBSD (PCI via <sys/pciio.h>, USB via built-in libusb 1.0)
- macOS (PCI and USB via IOKit)
- Linux (PCI and USB via sysfs)

Use GNU make to build on macOS or Linux, use the provided shell script to
build on FreeBSD:

   $ sh build_freebsd.sh clean
   $ sh build_freebsd.sh

It is possible to compile an experimental version of libuhwi which is ca-
pable of guessing PCI devices' names using a database file provided by
PCI IDs Project (bundled on every default installation of FreeBSD):

   # on FreeBSD
   $ ENABLE_PCI_DB=1 sh build_freebsd.sh

   # on macOS (for debugging purposes only as PCI device name strings
   # are provided by IOKit natively on Mac)
   $ make ENABLE_PCI_DB=1 CFLAGS="-DUHWI_PCI_DB_PATH_CONST=\"/valid/DB/path\""

   # on Linux
   $ make ENABLE_PCI_DB=1

Linking with the library requires you to link with the appropriate depen-
dencies as well since libuhwi is built as a static library:

   # on FreeBSD
   $ clang ... -L. -luhwi -lusb

   # on macOS
   $ clang ... -L. -luhwi -framework CoreFoundation -framework IOKit

UniHWI comes with lsuhwi - a command-line tool akin to lspci/usbconfig, but
using libuhwi instead:

   # dumps PCI and USB devices available on the system
   $ ./lsuhwi
   # dumps PCI and USB devices available on the system in JSON form
   $ ./lsuhwi -J

   # dumps just the PCI devices
   $ ./lsuhwi -l
   # dumps just the USB devices
   $ ./lsuhwi -u

   # dumps PCI devices in JSON form
   $ ./lsuhwi -l -J
   # dumps USB devices in JSON form
   $ ./lsuhwi -u -J

   # dumps PCI DB contents
   $ ./lsuhwi -d

   # mediocre built-in usage documentation
   $ ./lsuhwi -h
